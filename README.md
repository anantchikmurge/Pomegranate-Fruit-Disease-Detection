# Pomegranate Fruit Disease Detection

## Overview

The  Pomegranate Fruit Disease Detection  project uses Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to automatically identify and classify diseases in pomegranate fruits. The project aims to assist farmers and agricultural workers by providing early detection of diseases, enabling them to take preventive actions and improve crop productivity.

The project uses various ML and DL algorithms, including:

-  Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
-  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
-  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 

These models classify pomegranate diseases into different categories.

## Datasets

The dataset used for this project contains images of pomegranate fruits, labeled with the following disease classes:

-  Healthy 
-  Anthracnose 
-  Bacterial Blight 
-  Cercospora 
-  Alternaria 

The dataset was pre-processed and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

-  Python 
-  TensorFlow / Keras  (for CNN-based model)
-  Scikit-Learn  (for traditional ML models like SVM and KNN)
-  OpenCV  (for image processing)
-  NumPy / Pandas  (for data manipulation)
-  Matplotlib / Seaborn  (for data visualization)




## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

-  Python 3.x  installed on your machine.
- It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anantchikmurge/Pomegranate-Fruit-Disease-Detection.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

Make sure you have the dataset in the `dataset/` folder. If not, you can download it from the provided dataset link.

### Running the Project

You can run the Jupyter notebook `pomegranate_model.ipynb` for training and testing the models.

To start the notebook, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the `pomegranate_model.ipynb` notebook and run the cells.

## Models

This project implements the following models:

### 1.  Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
   - SVM was trained on image features extracted from the pomegranate fruit images.
   - It achieved a classification accuracy of  93%  on the test set.

### 2.  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
   - KNN was also trained on the image features, but performed slightly worse than SVM.
   - The accuracy was around  87% .

### 3.  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
   - CNN was used to directly process images and classify diseases.
   - It achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of  98%  on the test set.

## Results

-  SVM Accuracy:  93%
-  KNN Accuracy:  87%
-  CNN Accuracy:  98%

These models were evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess their performance in classifying the diseases accurately.

## Future Work

- Enhance the dataset with more images to improve model performance.
- Experiment with other advanced deep learning models like  ResNet  or  VGG  for better accuracy.
- Develop a mobile application for real-time disease detection using the trained models.
